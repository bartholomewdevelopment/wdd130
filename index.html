        <p>My name is Joseph Bartholomew, but I go by Joey.  I live in Ohio.  I am pursuing my Software Development degree, and like to build software and come up with new ideas for software solutions. I have experience with HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, some React, some Bootstrap, GitHub, and VSCode. I’ve taken a few coding bootcamps in programming, one from Skillsoft and one from NuCamp. I also have built a software called Overtime Athletic Management, but a large portion was done by a team of oversea contractors.  I’ve created an LLC business to help develop people’s ideas into websites and software but I’d like to pivot away from using the oversea contractors and do all the work myself which is why I’m trying to get my bachelors. You can see my current sites at <a href="https://bartdev.org">bartdev.org</a> and <a href="https://overtimeam.com">overtimeam.com</a>. I also enjoy basketball and spending time with my family.  I'm married and have 3 children.</p>

        <p>Ohio is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It borders Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest. Of the 50 U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest by area. With a population of nearly 11.8 million, Ohio is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated state. Its capital and most populous city is Columbus, with other large population centers including Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, and Toledo. Ohio is nicknamed the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes". Its flag is the only non-rectangular flag of all U.S. states.</p>
